<?php
//The include (or require) statement takes all the text/code/markup that exists in the specified file and copies it into the file that uses the include statement.
//Including files is very useful when you want to include the same PHP, HTML, or text on multiple pages of a website.

//---------------------------------  Deffrence Between  --------------------------------------------------
//require will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
//include will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue

//---------------------------------  Syntax  ------------------------------------------------------------------
//require 'filename.php'; // filename.php is the file you want to include
//include 'filename.php'; // filename.php is the file you want to include
