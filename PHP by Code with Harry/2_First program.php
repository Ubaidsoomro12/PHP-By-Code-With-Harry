//PHP echo and print Statements
//echo and print are more or less the same. 
//They are both used to output data to the screen.
//The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.
// echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument.
// echo is marginally faster than print.
